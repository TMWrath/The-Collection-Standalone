# The-Collection-Standalone
The Collection App is based off Wallpaper Board (v1.2.4) developed by Dani Mahardhika. Wallpaper Board is an open source wallpaper dashboard for         Android available at GitHub and is free to use. 
        All images within this app (unless noted otherwise) are owned by me (T.M. Wrath) or by Other Collection Artists (Lilum,Customworx). You have the rights to use these for personal use such as wallpapers but these images should not be redistributed without permission by the artist. Any other works from a none Collection Artist will have credit provided.
